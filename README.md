# Sickle Cell Detection Using InceptionV3

This project uses deep learning to detect sickle cell anemia from medical images. We leverage the **InceptionV3** architecture, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify images as positive (sickle cell detected) or negative (normal). The project includes both a Flask-based web application for easy usage and a React front-end for interaction.

## Project Overview
Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells. Early detection is crucial for managing the disease. In this project, we have implemented:
1. A deep learning model based on **InceptionV3** for image classification.
2. A Flask API to serve the model predictions.
3. A web interface built using **React** to upload images and view the detection results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (3.x)
- **TensorFlow** (for building and training the model)
- **Keras** (used within TensorFlow)
- **Flask** (backend API to serve predictions)
- **React.js** (frontend for web interface)
- **Git** (version control)
- **PyCharm** (IDE for development)

## Dataset
The dataset includes images categorized as:
- **Positive**: Images where sickle cells are detected.
- **Negative**: Images without sickle cells.

### How to Use Dataset
The dataset is automatically split into training and testing sets during preprocessing. Ensure the folder structure is as follows:

/data
  /Positive
  /Negative
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the interface, upload an image, and get predictions.

## Model Training
The **InceptionV3** architecture is used for feature extraction, with additional custom layers added for binary classification (positive/negative). Training involves the following steps:
- Unzipping and preprocessing the dataset.
- Using **ImageDataGenerator** for augmentation.
- Fine-tuning the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

### Results
Once trained, the model achieves the following performance on the test dataset:
- Accuracy: `X%`
- Precision: `X%`
- Recall: `X%`
- F1 Score: `X%`

## Web Application
The Flask API and React-based UI allow users to upload an image of blood cells and get a prediction on whether sickle cells are detected.

### Features:
- **Image Upload**: Upload a medical image via the web interface.
- **Model Prediction**: The model returns the classification (positive/negative).
- **Probability Bar Chart**: Displays the confidence levels of the prediction.
